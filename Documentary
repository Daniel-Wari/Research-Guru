    <h1 align="center"><strong>The Effects Of Cold Temperatures</strong></h1>
    <p>
      Low freezing temperatures are deadly if you do not how it affects you.
      When you're out in the wild during winter, a lot of health hazards may
      affect you as well as make you vulnerable, weaken your immune system and
      also may cause death. With the Midwest and Great Lakes regions in the
      midst of a life-threatening polar vortex, it’s helpful to understand how
      extreme cold environments affect the human body. The extreme cold can have
      an effect on your health in many ways.<br />Here are a few of the things
      to watch out for during these periods.
    </p>
    <h3>First, you could experience frostnip, followed by frostbite.</h3>

      alt="Frostbite"

    <p>
      Frostbite is a dire condition in which your skin and tissues freeze after
      being exposed to extreme cold for a prolonged amount of time, according to
      the University of Rochester Medical Center. Frostbite, which most commonly
      occurs on your fingers, toes, ears, and nose, can lead to severe and
      permanent blood vessel and tissue damage.<br />Luckily for most people,
      the chances of reaching that point are rare, and frostnip provides us with
      early warning signals before it gets that far. Frostnip is milder than
      frostbite and its symptoms include red, tingling or numb skin. If you
      begin to see or feel any of those signs, it is best to get yourself inside
      and away from the cold.
    </p>
    <h3>Prolonged exposure to extreme cold can lead to hypothermia.</h3>

    />
    <p>
      Hypothermia takes place when a person’s body loses heat at a rate quicker
      than it can produce it and their body temperature drops extremely low,
      according to the Mayo Clinic. Low body temperature can cause your heart,
      nervous system, and other organs to enter a state of shock, putting a
      person at risk of a heart attack, respiratory system failure and possibly
      death. Symptoms of hypothermia include shivering, slurred speech, slow
      breathing, lack of coordination and confusion. Elderly adults and young
      children are especially at risk.
    </p>
    <h3>Windburn can make your cheeks look red.</h3>

      alt="Windburn"
    />
    <p>
      Windburn occurs when your skin loses its natural oils due to its exposure
      to cold temperatures and low humidity in the air, Dr. Diane Meyer, a
      dermatologist at Marshfield Clinic Health System, told INSIDER. Windburn
      usually gives your cheeks a flushed appearance and makes your skin red,
      dry and itchy. Sometimes it may cause your skin to swell and heat up. To
      prevent windburn, cover your skin, including your face and hands as much
      as possible and consider wearing sunglasses or goggles if you’re doing any
      outdoor activities on cold, windy days.
    </p>
    <h3>Cold weather can cause your nose to run.</h3>

      height="900px"

      alt="Running Nose"
    />
    <p>
      A runny nose is one of the ways your body protects you from the cold. As
      part of the respiratory tract, your nose plays a key role in warming,
      humidifying and cleaning the air you breathe before it makes its way to
      your lungs. When your nose is hit with cold, dry air, it increases mucus
      production as an automatic defense mechanism to ensure ideal, humid
      conditions inside the nose, according to The Ohio State University Wexner
      Medical Center.
    </p>
    <h3>Shivering helps your body to generate heat to keep you warm.</h3>

      height="900px"
      width="1200px"
      alt="Shivering"
    />
    <p>
      Similar to a runny nose, shivering is another defense mechanism used by
      your body to keep the cold air from wreaking havoc. The quick muscular
      contractions are one way your body can generate heat to stop your body
      temperature from dropping dramatically, according to Harvard Medical
      Center.
    </p>
    <h3>Freezing temperatures can increase your risk of a heart attack.</h3>

      height="900px"
      width="1200px"
      alt="Heart Attack"
    />
    <p>
      When you put yourself in extremely cold environments, your heart has to
      work harder to circulate your blood. When you’re outside shoveling snow,
      the cold air can cause oxygen to unevenly distribute to various areas of
      your heart. In 2012, a team of Penn State researchers found that a healthy
      individual’s body can usually adapt to this and redistribute the blood
      flow. But for those with an existing heart condition, oxygen supply may
      become severely impaired and lead to a heart attack, they found.
    </p>
    <h3>Cold air can cause wheezing and shortness of breath.</h3>

      alt="Wheezing and shortness of breath"
    />
    <p>
      Cold air can go into your lungs. Cold air, which is typically very dry as
      well, can irritate your lungs and cause wheezing, coughing, and shortness
      of breath, according to the American Lung Association. This is especially
      true for people with asthma, COPD, or bronchitis. To protect yourself
      against any potential damage to your airways, experts recommend covering
      your nose and mouth with a scarf when going out into severe cold
      temperatures and avoiding outdoor exercises.
    </p>
    <h3>The cold air dries out your skin.</h3>

      alt="Dried Skin"
    />
    <p>
      Dealing with the extreme cold while you’re outside for a few minutes is
      one thing, but when you’re constantly reminded about it with itchy, dry
      skin that’s a whole different story. During the winter months, when the
      air is at its coldest and driest, your skin is the most susceptible to
      drying out. As humidity levels drop, ensuring your skin stays hydrated is
      a difficult task. In order to limit dryness, the American Skin Association
      recommends you regularly apply moisturizing creams, use a mild non-soap
      skin cleanser, always wear gloves and avoid rubbing or scratching the
      skin.
